<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a dentist who is currently learning programming and exploring a new
  direction in my career. I’m happily married to my wife Yuliia, and together we
  are excitedly waiting for the arrival of our baby daughter. In my free time, I
  enjoy playing Dota and relaxing with friends while smoking hookah.

<p>
  I am a dedicated dentist with a strong passion for helping people achieve
  healthy and confident smiles. I approach my work with precision, care, and a
  commitment to providing comfortable, high-quality treatment for every patient.
  Alongside my dental career, I am expanding my skills by studying programming,
  continually seeking new ways to grow both professionally and personally.
